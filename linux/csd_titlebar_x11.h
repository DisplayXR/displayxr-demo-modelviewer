 * @file
 * @brief  X11 glue for the shared client-side header bar.
 *
 * The bar itself — metrics, hit testing, interaction state, the translucent
 * rounded raster — is displayxr-common's displayxr::csd (common/
 * csd_titlebar.h, displayxr-common#52), the ONE chrome implementation shared
 * with the runtime's native-Wayland test-app leg. This app used to carry its
 * own copy; what remains here is only what is X11-specific: the desktop scale
 * (Xft.dpi), the bar's rect for the XShape input region, and XPutImage into the
 * top-level packed for its visual.
 *
 * WHY CLIENT-SIDE (unchanged): X11 gives a client no hook into a WM-owned move
 * (Windows has WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING; X11 only reports the result via
 * ConfigureNotify), so the drag must be the app's for every step to go through
 * the display processor's lattice snap. A visible, ordinary title bar is what
 * drives that drag. Do NOT "simplify" this back to WM decorations;
 * DXR_X11_WM_DECORATIONS=1 is the deliberate, unsnapped escape hatch.
 *
 * GEOMETRY (unchanged): the top-level is bar + content; the CONTENT child is
 * the window bound to the runtime, so the bar never enters the canvas, the
 * Kooima projection, the swapchain or the atlas, and the weave never covers it.
 *
 * TRANSLUCENT + ROUNDED on the 32-bit ARGB visual (under GNOME's always-on
 * compositing manager): the premultiplied raster's alpha is real, so the
 * desktop shows through the bar and outside its rounded top corners. On the
 * opaque root visual the glue asks the painter for an opaque, square bar
 * instead (setSurfaceHasAlpha(false)). The content child stays opaque either
 * way and weaves exactly as before.

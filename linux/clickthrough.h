 * @file
 * @brief  Click-through for the transparent model overlay (X11 and Wayland).
 *
 * The Linux analogue of the Windows leg's `dxr::ClickThroughRegion`
 * (displayxr-common/common/vk_clickthrough_region.h, runtime#833/#837), which
 * punches the window through to the desktop with SetWindowRgn. Here the region
 * goes through displayxr::linux_window's set_input_region(): an XShape
 * **ShapeInput** region on X11, the surface's input region on Wayland. Clicks
 * land on the model and pass through the transparent surround to whatever is
 * underneath. This file owns only the COVERAGE (the Vulkan readback and the
 * runs); the window system is the helper's.
 *
 * WHERE THE COVERAGE COMES FROM, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND SCENE PASS.
 * The Windows leg derives the region from the frame's OWN rendered view — a
 * downscale blit of the swapchain tile's alpha — and this file does the same.
 * The sibling avatar demo instead re-renders the subject into scratch images
 * (`displayxr-demo-avatar/linux/clickthrough.cpp`), which it can afford
 * because ITS `ModelRenderer::renderEye` sizes its internal MSAA/depth targets
 * to the VIEWPORT with a grow-only policy. modelviewer's renderer does not: it
 * keys `ensureTargets()` on `imageWidth/imageHeight` (model_renderer.cpp:2920),
 * so alternating a 3840x2160 swapchain with a small silhouette raster would
 * destroy and recreate 8x MSAA colour+depth targets EVERY FRAME. Reading the
 * already-rendered alpha costs one blit instead, and it has the further virtue
 * of describing exactly what the user is looking at.
 *
 * That choice also sidesteps the whole class of bug the avatar had to fix in
 * its scratch-image path (avatar #99: the silhouette image needs
 * COLOR_ATTACHMENT usage on top of TRANSFER, and `renderEye` picks its entry
 * layout from the viewport origin) — there is no scratch render target here,
 * only transfer-only coverage images.
 *
 * Everything downstream of the coverage IS the avatar's design, and it is
 * hardware-verified on X11:
 *
 *   - the raster SCALES with the window (kTexelPxDefault window px per texel,
 *     capped), so precision does not degrade as the window grows;
 *   - the coverage is the UNION of the FIRST and LAST view, from the SAME
 *     frame. The weave shows every view at once with horizontal disparity that
 *     grows with window size, so a single-view mask visibly clips the other
 *     view's content;
 *   - the alpha threshold is LOW (8) and the result is DILATED by one texel.
 *     The error is asymmetric: an over-large region leaves a few transparent
 *     pixels clickable, an under-large one makes content unreachable;
 *   - the readback is PIPELINED behind a fence and HOST_CACHED. A synchronous
 *     vkQueueWaitIdle on a write-combined buffer is what made this pass look
 *     too expensive to run at frame rate (~127 ms vs ~0.86 ms, measured on the
 *     Windows leg);
 *   - rects are one per horizontal run, with identical consecutive rows folded
 *     into a band, so a 4K window does not hand the X server thousands of
 *     rectangles per frame.
 *
 * CHROME IS UNIONED IN, NOT PUNCHED OUT. Anything drawn that is not the
 * model — the client-side title bar — must be part of the region or the
 * shaped window makes it unclickable. (That is the avatar's speech-bubble bug:
 * an un-unioned band is invisible to the pointer.) The window helper unions
 * its own header bar in, on both backends.
 *
 * REACHABILITY SAFETY NET. With the title bar unioned in the window is always
 * grabbable, but the shape is also applied when decorations are off, and a
 * silhouette that shrinks to almost nothing (model panned off screen, nothing
 * loaded) would leave a window that cannot be clicked or focused — you could
 * no longer press Ctrl+T to get it back. Below kMinCoveredPx of covered
 * window area the shape is therefore DROPPED rather than applied, and the
 * fall back is logged once per transition.
 *
 * No-op when there is no window (hosted-NULL fallback); the helper reports
 * once when the window system cannot express an input region.

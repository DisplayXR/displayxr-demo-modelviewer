// Unclipped-silhouette coverage (#127 / displayxr-runtime#1470).
//
// Paired with pbr.vert, into a single R8 attachment, to produce the silhouette
// the model WOULD have at an unrestricted rear depth budget. It is deliberately
// the emptiest possible fragment shader: the one and only thing that must NOT
// happen here is pbr.frag's `if (inViewZ > ubo.lightDir.w) discard;`, because
// that discard is exactly what makes the rendered alpha a function of the
// budget the runtime published — the feedback loop that makes the rear clip
// oscillate.
//
// It declares no inputs at all. pbr.vert's outputs (worldPos/normal/uv/viewZ/
// tangent) are simply left unconsumed, which Vulkan's shader-interface matching
// allows (extra vertex outputs are fine; a fragment input with no producer is
// not). Nothing here samples a texture, so no material descriptor set (set 1)
// needs to be bound for this pipeline.
//
// vec4 rather than float: the attachment is R8_UNORM and the pipeline's write
// mask is R only, so g/b/a are dropped — but a vec4 output against a
// single-component attachment is the form every driver in the matrix
// (native VK + MoltenVK) handles without comment.

REM ── Code signing (gated on %SIGN_CMD%) ──────────────────────────────
REM Signing is OFF unless SIGN_CMD is set in the environment (a signing-
REM capable build/release machine points it at the configured signer).
REM This repo carries NO cert and NO secret. A clone without SIGN_CMD
REM builds unsigned, exactly as before.
REM
REM The shipped binaries (demo exe + bundled openxr_loader.dll) MUST be
REM signed BEFORE makensis packs them — Smart App Control checks the
REM binaries extracted at install/load time, so signing the finished
REM installer alone is not enough. The installer .exe and the uninstaller
REM are signed at makensis time by the .nsi (!finalize + the two-pass
REM uninstaller block), driven by the /DSIGN_CMD passed below.
REM SIGN_ARG carries its own quotes so the empty (unsigned) case expands to
REM nothing rather than an empty quoted "" arg that makensis would choke on.
